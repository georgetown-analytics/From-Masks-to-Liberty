Abstract  
Reporting regarding COVID-19 vaccination policy has contained a lot of unknowns and contradictions. While early reports suggested that vaccine hesitancy may fall along boundaries of race (Young, 2021), other sources contradicted these claims (Summers, 2021). Over time, critiques of infrastructure and design in vaccine rollout seemed more plausible (Goldhill, 2021). The pipeline of distribution of COVID-19 vaccinations sparked political debates on best practices (Chason et al, 2021), and over time it became clear that politics was going to be an important consideration with regard to achieving herd immunity thresholds (Goldberg & Ollstein, 2021). 
With the new Biden administration and clear goals being established (Lonas, 2021), a schism in political narrative has been affecting the way that Americans perceive vaccination (Ingold, 2021). Research shows that those who are supporters of Donald Trump demonstrate increased vaccine hesitancy after being shown tweets where he makes negative claims about vaccines, while those who do not support him show no increase or decrease in vaccine hesitancy (Hornsey et al., 2020). Since political and geographic demographics overlap, this political controversy has tertiary effects, which should be considered as policy makers decide on tactics for keeping different populations safe. Among many potential issues, one important example is that States may achieve benchmarks for herd immunity, yet at the same time a County level analysis reveals a less optimistic picture, where certain counties act as incubation chambers for COVID-19 to continue to spread, evolve, and potentially re-infect those who have the vaccine (Mendez, 2021). 
Since our project relates to events as they have been happening, rather than reviewing established data, our goals and considerations evolved over time relating to our understanding. While we began the project hoping to predict when the United States would achieve herd immunity, we attempted to cast a wide net, looking at Census data, Center for Disease Control (CDC) data, political features, and vaccine symptoms. Ultimately, our project has culminated in a machine learning feature importance analysis and consideration paired with insights from exploratory data analysis, which will show important yet not necessarily obvious considerations for understanding COVID-19 vaccinations in the United States, and some of the broader implications of the data we currently have available.
